Lightning fast tilemaps for [`bevy`](https://bevyengine.org/).

## Features

- Very high rendering performance (hundreds of fps, largely independent of map size)
- Tilemaps can be very large or have many "layers"
- Rectangular and isometric (axonometric) tile maps.
- Tiles can overlap either by "dominance" rule or by perspective
- Optional custom mesh for which the map serves as a texture

## How it works

The whole map is rendered as a single quad and a custom shader cares for rendering the
correct tiles at the correct position.

Thus each map works with two textures: One with integer data type, constructed and maintained
internally for storing for each tile position which tile index should be displayed there. And the
other being a tile atlas that contains all the tiles. This one should be provided by you (see [assets/](assets/) for
atlas examples).

As of this writing, this should be (much) faster than most other bevy tilemap implementations out
there.

## Limitations

- Only tested on Windows, no WASM support
- No direct animation support, but you can easily update the tilemap in regular intervals
  to achieve the same (see [Animation Example](examples/animation.rs))

## Related work

If you dont require all of `bevy_fast_tilemap`s performance and are looking for an approach that
supports some more tile shapes and allows to treat each tile as a separate entity, take a look at
[bevy_ecs_tilemap](https://github.com/StarArawn/bevy_ecs_tilemap/) which (among others) inspired
this work.

## Examples

Check out the [examples/](examples/) folder to get an overview.
You can run the examples like this:

```bash
cargo run --example updates
cargo run --example layers
cargo run --example iso
cargo run --example iso2
cargo run --example bench
...
```
